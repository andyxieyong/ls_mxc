Mixed-Criticality DAG Framework

Mixed-criticality framework for MC-DAGs. This framework is capable of scheduling systems composed of one or more MC-DAGs for multi-core architectures. The scheduler is efficient and ensures safe mode transitions for Mixed-Criticality systems.

Besides the scheduling implementation, this framework also includes a generator of random MC-DAGs. Random MC systems can be generated by this tool in order to test scheduling policies.

Finally, the computation of availability rates for LO criticality outputs in single-DAG systems has been implemented.

## Scheduler

The scheduler uses List Scheduling to allocate tasks to cores. The HI scheduling table is computed first in order to determine **safe** activation instants for HI criticality tasks. The LO scheduling table is then computed by allowing preemption and migration of tasks when the activation instants of HI criticality tasks occur.

## Generator

The benchmarking tool generates random systems specified as XML files. Each system is composed of one or more MC-DAGs which parameters can be set by the user.

## Availability

This framework is also capable of performing a model transformation to compute availability rates for LO outputs of a MC-DAG. Models generated are probabilistic automata used by the [PRISM Model Checker](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/).
