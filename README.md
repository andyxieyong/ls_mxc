List Scheduling for Mixed-Criticality Graphs
====

Mixed-criticality scheduler for MC-DAGs. This implementation is able to schedule MC-DAGs for multi-core architectures with Mixed-critcality. The scheduler is efficient and ensures that safe mode transitions are possible.

This simulator has an implementation of the algorithm in addition to a generator
of MC DAGs.

## Scheduler

## Generator

The benchmarking tool generates random DAGs to be evaluated by the scheduling algorithm.
